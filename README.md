# Seeter-Client

Seeter is a very simple text-based tweeter application for in-house use by your
organisation. The intent is to provide a lightweight messaging library that can be quickly integrated into
other development projects, e.g., by running it from shell scripts, embedding it into other applications,
and so on.

Seeter uses a basic client-server architecture. The server records a database of topics, and a list of seet
messages published to each topic so far. A seet contains just the username of the author, and a short
line of text as the message body. Clients connected to the server can fetch the existing seets for a topic,
and publish new seets.

Your teammates have developed the Server in Java and, notably, message classes for the client-server
communication. They have specified the concepts mentioned above (topic, seet, etc.) in more detail in
the Javadoc of this base framework â€“ see the Javadoc for the sep.seeter.server package, and also
the message classes.

To test the server, they also wrote a makeshift Client in Java. This Client supports some basic
functionality, but it is buggy, incomplete and lacking any real design. Instructions on running the Client
can be found in the Javadoc of the sep.seeter.client.Client class.
Ultimately, your organisation requires this prototype Client to be refactored and redesigned according to
the following Specification. 

The Seeter client was a project set within the Software Engineering Practice module, of which we were given the task
the refactor and redesign the 'Seeter' Client so that it uses the Command pattern whilst also adopting the MVC framework.

The Commands 
exit [any]      -> Terminated Exit the app
fetch [topic]   -> Fetch seets for [topic] from the server
compose [topic] ->  Start drafting new seets for [topic]
body [line]     ->  Add a new seet line to the current draft
send Drafting   -> Main Publish current draft seets on the server
